# Working with Genererics

## Task Instructions

 Write a generic method to count the number of elements in a collection that have a specific property
(for example, odd, integers, prime numbers, palindromes).

## Solution Description

This project provides the deliverable for the week 1 topic of **working with generics**. The solution involves
providing a `count()` method in a utility class for counting the elements of a collection that satisfy a particular condition.
This solution also provides unit tests to test functionalities of the util method.

## Setup
- Clone this repository by using:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:timiwritescode/flexisaf-tasks.git
```
- Change directory from root directory into the `task1` directory using:
```bash
$ cd task1
```

- Run unit tests using:
```bash
mvn test
```
**_N.B_** To test different functionalities of the utility method, you can add more test cases to the existing test cases.
